            <p>In 2018, amidst a growing awareness of health & sustainability, our founder, Louise Wyatt, a nutritionist with a passion for culinary arts & Alexandra Bell, a chef with a knack for creating flavorful, nutrient-dense dishes, embarked on a mission to revolutionize the catering industry. Their journey began with a shared vision: to offer a catering service that not only satisfies the palate but also supports a healthier lifestyle and a more sustainable planet. </p>
<br />
<p>They realized that while many people wanted to eat healthier, they often struggled to find catering options that met their needs. Determined to bridge this gap, Louise & Alexandra launched H&H in early 2019. They focused on creating menus that were not only rich in flavor but also packed with nutrients. Their approach was simple yet revolutionary: each dish had to be crafted with ingredients that were organic, locally sourced, and seasonally appropriate. As word spread about their unique approach to catering, H&H quickly gained a reputation for excellence.</p>
<br />
<p>Their innovative menu options catered to a variety of dietary needs, including vegan, gluten-free & low-carb diets. To further their mission, they introduced a range of eco-friendly practices, including compostable packaging & a zero-waste policy.</p>
